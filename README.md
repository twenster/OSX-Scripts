# OSX Scripts #

Collection of useful Bash scripts I use.

##Mount Remote.sh##
Using OSXFuse and SSHFS, this script mount one drive from a remote server, using encrypted SSH connection.

Configure the SSH user, server, remote path and local folder in the script.

OSXFuse and SSHFS ca be downloaded on [https://osxfuse.github.io](https://osxfuse.github.io)

##Reset Network.sh##

Tired to go to the Preferences panel to switch off then on the network, this script does sthe same. However it asks for the user password to use the sudo command.
